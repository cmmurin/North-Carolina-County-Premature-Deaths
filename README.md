# North Carolina County Premature Deaths
This is a data repository about each North Carolina County's premature death rates and average poor mental health days for the year 2015. The data is National Public Health data provided by Professor Gotzler at UNC Chapel Hill.  
## Contents
The repository contains a [Python notebook](https://github.com/cmmurin/North-Carolina-County-Premature-Deaths/blob/main/Creating%20a%20Subset/Creating_a_Subset%20(1).ipynb) explaining how to make a subset from a .csv.
  - This notebook was made using Google CoLab, but will work in anything that supports .ipynb files.

Also, in the [Data](https://github.com/cmmurin/North-Carolina-County-Premature-Deaths/tree/main/Data) folder, there are two .csv files.

1. [CountyHealthData_2014-2015.csv](https://github.com/cmmurin/North-Carolina-County-Premature-Deaths/blob/main/Data/CountyHealthData_2014-2015.csv) contains information on various health related statistics for each American county for the years 2014 and 2015. This is where the data for the subset was selected. 
2. [CD_2015.csv](https://github.com/cmmurin/North-Carolina-County-Premature-Deaths/blob/main/Data/CD2015_subset.csv) is the subset containing the premature death rates and average poor mental health days per North Carolina county for 2015. It was made using the instructions in the Python notebook. 

## Purpose
This data subset was created to find a possible correlation between premature death and poor mental health days, in hope that if there is a strong correlation, then further research and additional help can be provided.
## Getting Started
If you wish to create your own data repository, open the [Python notebook](https://github.com/cmmurin/North-Carolina-County-Premature-Deaths/blob/main/Creating%20a%20Subset/Creating_a_Subset.ipynb) in a place that supports it, such as [Google CoLab](https://colab.research.google.com/), for step-by-step instructions.
