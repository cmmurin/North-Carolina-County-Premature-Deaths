# North Carolina County Premature Deaths
This is a data repository about each North Carolina County's premature death rates and average poor mental health days for the year 2015.  
## Contents
The repository contains a [Python notebook](https://github.com/cmmurin/North-Carolina-County-Premature-Deaths/blob/main/Creating%20a%20Subset/Creating_a_Subset.ipynb) explaining how to make a subset from a .csv.
  - This notebook was made using Google CoLab, but will work in anything that supports .ipynb files.

Also, in the [Data](https://github.com/cmmurin/North-Carolina-County-Premature-Deaths/tree/main/Data) folder, there are two .csv files.

1. [CountyHealthData_2014-2015.csv](https://github.com/cmmurin/North-Carolina-County-Premature-Deaths/blob/main/Data/CountyHealthData_2014-2015.csv) contains information on various health related statistics for each American county for the years 2014 and 2015. This is where the data for the subset was selected. 
2. [CD_2015.csv](https://github.com/cmmurin/North-Carolina-County-Premature-Deaths/blob/main/Data/CD2015_subset.csv) is the subset containing the premature death rates and average poor mental health days per North Carolina county for 2015. It was made using the instructions in the Python notebook. 

## Purpose
This data subset was created to find a possible correlation between premature death and poor mental health days, in hope that if there is a strong correlation, then further research and additional help can be provided.
## Getting Started
If you wish to create your own data repository, open the [Python notebook](https://github.com/cmmurin/North-Carolina-County-Premature-Deaths/blob/main/Creating%20a%20Subset/Creating_a_Subset.ipynb) in a place that supports it, such as [Google CoLab](https://colab.research.google.com/), for step-by-step instructions.
